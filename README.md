## Introduction

This dashboard was built for **Job Seekers, Career Transitioners, and Data Professionals** to solve a common challenge: job market insights are often scattered, inconsistent, and difficult to interpret.

Using a real-world dataset of 2024 data job postings — including job titles, salaries, locations, and employment types — this project consolidates key insights into a single, interactive analytics experience. The goal is to provide a clear, data-driven view of market demand, compensation trends, and geographic hiring patterns.
